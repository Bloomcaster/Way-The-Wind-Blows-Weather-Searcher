This is a weather app so that the user can type in a city and the wind, temperature and humidity readings will not only populate for that day but also give a five day forecast as well. Through local storage the cities that the user types in will be saved to their device. This page used the openweather api to populate the data for the conditions stated on the page. There is also use of bootstrap, moment.js, google fonts and jQuery so that the page is more dynamic. Unfortunately, there are some issues with my code for the days and weather to work properly on the page.
